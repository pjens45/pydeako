"""
Connection pool for Deako bridges with primary/failover support.

Manages two bridge connections:
  - An active primary Deako used for live device commands.
  - A standby bridge held warm by a single TCP keepalive socket so
    that a failover switch does not have to wait for the bridge to
    leave idle mode.

Recovery is caller-driven. There is no background health monitor and
no periodic task. The `control_device()` send path triggers at most
one failover switch per call on a real send failure; once the pool
is in a degraded state the next `control_device()` call invokes a
two-host recovery routine that probes and connects to
`primary_host` first, then `failover_host`.

`stop()` is terminal. A stopped pool is not restartable. Callers
that want a fresh pool must construct a new one. Host names
(`primary_host`, `failover_host`) are `str` for the lifetime of the
pool and never nulled out on any path; degraded state is signaled
through `ConnectionPoolState`, not missing host fields.
